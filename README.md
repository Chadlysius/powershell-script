# powershell-script
My PowerShell Script

Rename.ps1


- It renames the png & jpg to folder name + old name

Delete.ps1


- It deletes based on hash 





osu!.ps1
![osu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108415154/197348985-ed3e014a-dfc3-4224-9e61-dc29b896a0b1.mp4)

- A PowerShell(7.2, doesn't work on 5.x) script that gets the mp3 of every map in osu! and correctly renames it because most mp3s are named audio.mp3
