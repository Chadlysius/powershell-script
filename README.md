# powershell-script
My PowerShell Script

Rename.ps1


- It renames the png & jpg to folder name + old name

Delete.ps1


- It deletes based on hash 

osu!.ps1


- A PowerShell(7.2, doesn't work on 5.x) script that gets the mp3 of every map in osu! and correctly renames it because most mp3s are named audio.mp3
